<p>Ut in Editione nostra <span class = "smallcaps">Livii</span>
publicanda antesignanum et ducem secutus sum Cl.&nbsp;<span class =
"smallcaps">Ruperti</span>, ita in edendo atque illustrando
C.&nbsp;Silii Italici poemate ad ejusdem auspicia et vexilla volui me
convertere, quia, ut aiebat Heynius in præfatione (quam ad calcem operis
rejiciam), ille in Silio interpretando operam posuit tam doctam et
accuratam, ut æqui judices inter meliores eum habituri sint interpretes,
qui criticam sollertiam cum interpretandi subtilitate præclare
conjunxerit.</p>

<p>Mens quidem aliquando mihi fuerat, quum de Silio Italico bene mereri
vellem, in hac editione novum de integro laborem exantlare, perpetuasque
adnotationes proferre, quas ideo ad concinnandas adjutorem quærebam, et
jam virum omni doctrinarum supellectile adornatum, ut in id opus se
accingeret, invitaveram.</p>

<p>Antiquorum enim poetarum, viri docti nullum fere magis, quam Silium,
neglexere, et, qui optime etiam de eo meriti sunt, ad interpretationem
tamen carminis parum contulere, omnemque pæne operam in critica ejus
tractatione posuerunt. Quicumque igitur editionem, Silio dignam,
meditatur, ei nova adeoque lubrica via ingredienda; et non contextus
tantum, quam et
<span class = "pagenum">x</span>
<a name = "pagex" id = "pagex"> </a>
accuratissimo et modestissimo potissimum judicio fieri potest,
constituendus, sed poeta etiam perpetuo inprimis commentario
illustrandus est.</p>

<p>Ea sunt quæ Cl. <i>Ruperti</i> sibi proposuit et perfecit: cujus
operam quo attentius legi ac perpendi, eo magis visum est, frustra me
operam impensamque consumpturum, quum tales forent in manibus opes.
Sagacissimi enim ingenii vir, ipsum poetam perpetuis commentariis
illustrare, et lectionem carminis, cujus omnem varietatem enotavit, ad
fidem codd. accuratius constituere, et vulgarem atque antiquam vel
revocare et tueri, vel emendare conatus est. Var. lect. ab
interpretatione seposuit, et inde duplicem commentarii sui partem fecit,
ut major lux eniteret, faciliorque foret alterutrum quærentibus
labor.</p>

<p>Hunc itaque optimum ducem existimavi et secutus sum, adjectis
quibusdam, quæ aut necessaria, aut certe bona viderentur: nam præcipua
hæc cura fuit, ut quicumque mea editione uteretur, reliquis omnibus
carere posset, et in ea reperiret, quidquid boni atque utilis ad Silii
carmen explicandum emendandumque alii contulissent. Sæpius quoque loca
similia e gallicis scriptoribus transcripsi, quique easdem res aut
tractassent, aut memorassent, verbi causa, <i>Bossuet</i>,
<i>Montesquieu</i>, eos contuli; quod præsertim in posterioribus libris
deprehendes, quum hic plura sint Silio et Nostris communia.</p>

<p>Quæ autem Cl. <i>Ruperti</i> ad calcem operis addenda aut corrigenda
subjunxerat, sive ex interpretatione Ernesti et Lenzii, sive ex notis
criticis Withofii excerpta, hæc ego in suum quæque locum retuli,
composui, concinnavi.</p>

<p>Eæ quidem fuerunt causæ, cur paulo fortasse longius excreverit labor;
sed hæc si culpa est, ingenue fateor
<span class = "pagenum">xi</span>
<a name = "pagexi" id = "pagexi"> </a>
volens peccasse, et cum ipso Goettingensi editore sic excusatum habeas
velim:</p>

<blockquote>
“Non defuere, qui nimiam reprehenderent copiam tam exemplorum dictionis
alicujus aut elegantiæ, quam veterum recentiorumque scriptorum, in rebus
historicis, geographicis ac mythicis a me laudatorum. Id tamen ex vano
eruditionis ostentandæ studio profectum existimari nolim, et res justam
excusationem habere videtur. Primum enim haud dissimulo, me omnem
dedisse operam, ut quam plurimis satisfacerem; neque vero ignorabam,
permultos etiam hodie esse viros doctissimos, quibus hæc rerum
verborumque illustrandorum ratio adrideat, quæ olim Nic. Heinsio,
Burmanno, Broekhusio, Drakenborchio aliisque magni nominis hominibus
probabatur: quorum tamen vestigia non ita sequutus sum, ut exempla
tantum exquisitioris loquendi formæ cumularem, nulla habita ratione
originis ejus vel causæ, indolis ac significatus, nec admonito de iis
lectore; nisi forte illa vel ex locis adscriptis satis intelligi et
legentibus jam hac compendiaria via, qua chartæ parcitur, in memoriam
revocari possent, vel ibi ab aliis, quorum editiones ac libri omnium
fere manibus teruntur, jam explicata essent. Deinde in doctissimo poeta
interpretando versabar, in quo adhibendæ talis eruditionis facultas et
major erat, et aptior atque utilior. Denique id egi, ut non tirones
modo, sed eruditos quoque homines et juventutis potissimum magistros
meam Silii editionem consuluisse haud omnino pœniteret, atque iis, qui
longiores disputationes de tot exquisitis dicendi formulis, rebusque
historicis, mythicis ac geographicis, ubivis in doctissimo poeta obviis
desiderarent, (quales passim inveniuntur) uberiores,
<span class = "pagenum">xii</span>
<a name = "pagexii" id = "pagexii"> </a>
unde eas peterent, fontes in promtu essent, et quidem plerique vel adeo
omnes, ut, si hunc vel illum adire non possent, (quæ tristis multorum
sors est) ad alios confugerent.”</blockquote>

<p>Commentationem vero de Silii vita et carmine in alterum volumen
rejeci: ibi vir doctiss. de ejus genere, nominibus, studiis, honoribus,
vita ac morte disputat; deinde in carminis indolem, consilium ac fontes,
e quibus poeta hausisse videatur, inquirit; tum de præstantia illius, et
de utilitate quæ percipi possit ex ejus lectione, disserit; quo facto,
codices MSS. et editiones Silii recenset; in fine denique, quale
consilium post virorum doctorum conatus in molienda editione secutus
sit, declarat.</p>

<p>Tum subjungentur testimonia ac judicia; et Catalogus editionum ex
integro concinnatus.</p>

<p>Accedet <i>Index rerum verborumque</i>, in quo potissimum desudavit
auctor, et quem pro desperato centies abjectum, reputata tamen utilitate
rei, in poeta potissimum tam docto conspicua, repetiit, et telam,
impatientia toties abruptam, diligenter retexuit. Non defuere quidem
editores poetæ, qui ante ipsum tales conficere indices laboraverint: sed
Drakenborchianus non nisi ad criticas virorum doctorum observationes,
Schmidianus ad notas Drakenb. et Heinsiorum, Ernestinus, qui omnium
uberrimus est, ad sola verba spectat. Dausqueianus, Cellarianus et
Bipontinus tam latinitatis, quam rerum rationem habent, at nimis manci
sunt. Is, vero quem, diligenter toto carmine iterum perlecto,
concinnavit, memorabiles res, voces ac dictiones continet omnes, et
præterea, quidquid vel in notis vel in Var. Lect. illustratur, adpositis
literis <i>n.</i> et <i>V.L.</i> indicat.
<span class = "pagenum">xiii</span>
<a name = "pagexiii" id = "pagexiii"> </a>
Maluit quoque nimiam sibi copiam, quam brevitatem exprobrari posse, et
quædam tenuia nec adeo necessaria irrepere, quam quidquam prætermitti,
quod si non omnibus, certe nonnullis notatu dignum videri posset.</p>

<p>Indicem excipit <i>Appendicula</i>, in juventutis potissimum gratiam
adnexa, quam tamen, nisi lectores passim ad eam auctor remisisset,
brevitatis studio omisissem, quanquam ex ea non minimus fructus percipi
potest.</p>

<p>Ea sunt quæ monitum te, lector optime, volui: felix, si mea tibi
adriserit opera, quam foveas et adjuves, precor. Vive, et vale.</p>

<h4>Transcriber’s Notes</h4>

<h5><a name = "structure" id = "structure">
Layout and Structure of the Text</a></h5>

<p>In the original book, each page had three sections: the poem itself;
the Variae Lectiones; and the commentary. For this e-text, the poem and
notes&mdash; broken into small segments&mdash; have been kept together,
while the Variae Lectiones have been placed in a block at the end of
each Book. All words discussed in the Variae have been underlined, with
links in both directions.</p>

<h5><a name = "greek" id = "greek">
For readers without Greek</a></h5>

<p>Greek used in this text falls into a few distinct groups:</p>

<p class = "inset">
&mdash;Quotations from Greek works illustrating literary devices used by
the author or giving historical or linguistic background<br>
&mdash;Greek forms of names used in the poem<br>
&mdash;Grammatical or literary terms that have no Latin equivalent</p>

<p>In general, Greek words have only been given mouse-hover
transliterations where necessary for linguistic explanations such as the
derivation of a place name. The word <span class = "greek" title =
"to">τὸ</span> (occasionally in the dative form <span class = "greek"
title = "tôi">τῷ</span>) is a definite article, meaning “<i>the word</i>
X”. Common adverbs are:</p>

<p class = "inset">
<span class = "greek" title = "sarkastikôs">σαρκαστικῶς</span>,
“sarcastically”<br>
<span class = "greek" title = "huperbolikôs">ὑπερβολικῶς</span>,
“hyperbolically”<br>
<span class = "greek" title = "archaïkôs">ἀρχαϊκῶς</span>, old-fashioned
(“archaically”)<br>
<span class = "greek" title = "deiktikôs">δεικτικῶς</span>, pointing
out<br>
<span class = "greek" title = "deinôs">δεινῶς</span>, “wonderfully” or
“terribly” according to context, but best translated as “the author is
showing off”.</p>

<p>Citations from the <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i> are shown as
printed. The editors generally used lower-case letters for both works;
inconsistencies are in the original.</p>


<h5><a name = "crossref" id = "crossref">
Cross-References in the Notes, Variae and Index</a></h5>

<p>Cross-references supplied by the editors themselves&mdash;Ruperti or
Lemaire&mdash;are linked directly to the referenced passage (text, notes
or variae). In general, lines cited by other scholars (“Draken. ad...”,
“D.&nbsp;Heins. laudat...”) are not linked. To aid in linking, missing
line numbers were added to the Notes. These numbers are shown in
<i>italics</i> with a mouse-hover reminder: <a class = "missing" href =
"#crossref" title = "numerus deest">323.</a> or (<a class = "missing"
href = "#crossref" title = "numerus deest">v.&nbsp;323</a>). Duplicate
numbers in the original are unchanged.</p>

<p>Known errors in cross-references are similarly italicized and
labeled. Cross-references with minor errors are shown as printed, but
linked to the correct line: “cf. <a class = "crossref missing" href =
"files/bookIII.html#not3_163" title = "recte 163">ad III, 162</a>”.
<i>Not all errors have been found.</i></p>

<p>References between the Notes and Variae for any one line are not
directly linked, but both are linked to the main text.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
